  - id: select:javascript:v1
    fn: __select__
    # The ternary operator is identical in Ruby and JS, so an inline template
    # isn't strictly necessary as the LIR `select` op can generate it directly.
    # But for completeness, an `impl` would be:
    impl: "(condition, true_val, false_val) => condition ? true_val : false_val"
